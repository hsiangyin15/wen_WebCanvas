### How to use 

    Each function has its own option box which will show when the user clicks on the function's button.Options including size,color,font typeface.Notice that the option box appears in the bottom of the page. 
    Click on the canvas before executing  the undo function so that it can work properly.
    Remember to select the font size for inputing strings, otherwise it may not show.

### Function description
    I add a bucket function which is designed for the user to chage the backgroung color.
    The draw slash function doesn't provide preview.
    The  multi-slash function allows you to drag slowly and create dancing lines. 
    There's also an interesting favicon there drawn by me, poor drawing skill as you can see...
